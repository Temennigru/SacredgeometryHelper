A C implementation done by Cognoscan. I just updated the UI to roll the dice for you.

I plan on someday compiling this to js and making it platform independent, unlike all other implementations out there.

How to run: Compile sg.c either with the provided Makefile (type 'make' into the terminal) or use some sort of SDK to compile (such as lcc). Then just run the executable.
